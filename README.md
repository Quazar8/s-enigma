# S-Enigma

## A simple electron js desktop app for encrypting and decrypting texts.

The app consists of three input fields. The one on the top is for the keyword used to encrypt and decrypt the text. Having a keyword typed in and a text for it to be used on will show the resulted texts under the appropriate input fields with an animation. Changing either the keyword or the text will result in changing the output texts as well.

## Technologies being used:
* **electron.js**
* **electron-forge**
* **_vanilla js and vanilla css_**

## Script commands in the app:

* **npm start** will run the app through node.js with index.html as an entry point

* **npm run make** will generate a folder with an executable that you can run right away and a folder with instalation files if you want to install the app
based on the operating system you currently run the script command in
